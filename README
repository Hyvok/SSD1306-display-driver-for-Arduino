Here is a library for controlling SSD1306 based displays with an arduino. This repo is related to my blog post at http://www.dgkelectronics.com/using-a-neat-little-oled-display-with-an-arduino/ 
I will most likely split the library (when I get around to it) to just the interface part and separate font handler/graphics core.

If you want to use the demo in the arduino_oled_demo folder you need to copy the library and font files to the same folder so you can compile it.

Compiles with Arduino 1.0 and avr-gcc 4.5.3, and currently just 128x32 pixel displays are supported. Tested with UG-2832HSWEG04 -type OLED display.
